## General Info
This is a virtual form of the traditional 'Rock Paper Scissors' game but you will be playing against computer this time. You need to make a choice and as you make it the screen will be updated with the result of the match. On each 'win' a score of +1 is added to the winner's score while no update on scores is make on 'lose' or 'tie'. The match will continue until either you or computer score 5 points and then the winner is declared. The match is reset after that.
